I. CONCENTRATION OF PRODUCTION AND MONOPOLIES"},{photoname:"",text:"The enormous growth of industry and the remarkably rapid concentration of production in ever-larger enterprises are one of the most characteristic features of capitalism. Modern production censuses give most complete and most exact data on this process."},{photoname:"",text:"In Germany, for example, out of every 1,000 industrial enterprises, large enterprises, i.e., those employing more than 50 workers, numbered three in 1882, six in 1895 and nine in 1907; and out of every 100 workers employed,"},{photoname:"",text:"this group of enterprises employed. 22, 30 and 37, respectively. Concentration of production, however, is much more intense than the concentration of workers, since labour in the large enterprises is much more productive."},{photoname:"",text:"This is shown by the figures on steam-engines and electric motors. If we take what in Germany is called industry in the broad sense of the term, that is, including commerce, transport, etc."},{photoname:"",text:"we get the following picture. Large-scale enterprises, 30,588 out of a total of 3,265,623, that is to say, 0.9 per cent. These enterprises employ 5,700,000 workers out of a total of 14,400,000, i.e.,"},{photoname:"",text:"39.4 per cent; they use 6,600,000 steam horse power out of a total of 8,800,000, i.e., 75.3 per cent, and 1,200,000 kilowatts of electricity out of a total of 1,500,000, i.e., 77.2 per cent."},{photoname:"",text:"Less than one-hundredth of the total number of enterprises utilise more than three-fourths of the total amount of steam and electric power! Two million nine hundred and seventy thousand small enterprises (employing up to five workers),"},{photoname:"",text:"constituting 91 per cent of the total, utilise only 7 per cent of the total amount of steam and electric power! Tens of thousands of huge enterprises are everything; millions of small ones are nothing."},{photoname:"",text:"In 1907, there were in Germany 586 establishments employing one thousand and more workers, nearly one-tenth (1,380,000) of the total number of workers employed in industry, and they consumed almost one-third (32 per cent) of the total amount of steam"},{photoname:"",text:" and electric power.[1] As we shall see, money capital and the banks make this superiority of a handful of the largest enterprises still more overwhelming, in the most literal sense of the word, i.e., millions of small, medium "},{photoname:"",text:"and even some big â€œproprietorsâ€ are in fact in complete subjection to some hundreds of millionaire financiers."},{photoname:"",text:"n another advanced country of modern capitalism, the United States of America, the growth of the concentration of production is still greater. Here statistics single out industry in the narrow sense of the word and classify enterprises "},{photoname:"",text:"according to the value of their annual output. In 1904 large-scale enterprises with an output valued at one million dollars and over, numbered 1,900 (out of 216,180, i.e., 0.9 per cent). These employed"},{photoname:"",text:"1,400,000 workers (out of 5,500,000, i.e., 25.6 per cent) and the value of their output amounted to $5,600,000,000 (out of $14,800,000,000, i.e., 38 per cent). Five years later, in 1909,"},{photoname:"",text:"the corresponding figures were: 3,060 enterprises (out of 268,491, i.e., 1.1 per cent) employing 2,000,000 workers (out of 6,600,000, i.e., 30.5 per cent) with an output valued at $9,000,000,000 (out of $20,700,000,000, i.e., 43.8 per cent). [2]

"},{photoname:"",text:"Almost half the total production of all the enterprises of the country was carried on by one-hundredth part of these enterprises! These 3,000 giant enterprises embrace 258 branches of industry. "},{photoname:"",text:"From this it can be seen that at a certain stage of its development concentration itself, as it were, leads straight to monopoly, for a score or so of giant enterprises can easily arrive at an agreement, and on the other hand"},{photoname:"",text:"the hindrance to competition, the tendency towards monopoly, arises from the huge size of the enterprises. This transformation of competition into monopoly is one of the most importantâ€”if not the most important"},{photoname:"",text:"â€”phenomena of modern capitalist economy, and we must deal with it in greater detail. But first we must clear up one possible misunderstanding.

"},{photoname:"",text:"American statistics speak of 3,000 giant enterprises in 250 branches of industry, as if there were only a dozen enterprises of the largest scale for each branch of industry."},{photoname:"",text:"But this is not the case. Not in every branch of industry are there large-scale enterprises; and moreover, a very important feature of capitalism in its highest stage of development is so-called combination of production, that is to say, the grouping"},{photoname:"",text:" in a single enterprise of different branches of industry, which either represent the consecutive stages in the processing of raw materials (for example, the smelting of iron ore into pig-iron,"},{photoname:"",text:" the conversion of pig-iron into steel, and then, perhaps, the manufacture of steel goods)â€”or are auxiliary to one another (for example, the utilisation of scrap, or of by-products, the manufacture of packing materials, etc.)."},{photoname:"",text:"â€œCombination,â€ writes Hilferding, â€œlevels out the fluctuations of trade and therefore assures to the combined enterprises a more stable rate of profit. Secondly, combination has the effect of eliminating trade. Thirdly,"},{photoname:"",text:" it has the effect of rendering possible technical improvements, and, consequently, the acquisition of superprofits over and above those obtained by the â€˜pureâ€™ (i.e,, non-combined) enterprises.

An Anarchist FAQ by Iain McKay
-------------------

  What is anarchism?
 Credit To Wikisource"},{photoname:"",text:"Anarchism is a political theory which aims to create anarchy, "the absence of a master, of a sovereign."[1] In other words, anarchism is a political theory which aims to create a society within which individuals freely co-operate together as equals.

"},{photoname:"",text:" As such anarchism opposes all forms of hierarchical controlâ€”be that control by the state or a capitalistâ€”as harmful to the individual and their individuality as well as unnecessary.

In the words of anarchist L. Susan Brown:"},{photoname:"",text:""While the popular understanding of anarchism is of a violent, anti-State movement, anarchism is a much more subtle and nuanced tradition then a simple opposition to government power."},{photoname:"",text:"Anarchists oppose the idea that power and domination are necessary for society, and instead advocate more co-operative, anti-hierarchical forms of social, political and economic organisation."[2]"},{photoname:"",text:"However, "anarchism" and "anarchy" are undoubtedly the most misrepresented ideas in political theory. Generally, the words are used to mean "chaos" or "without order," and so, by implication, "},{photoname:"",text:"anarchists desire social chaos and a return to the "laws of the jungle."

"},{photoname:"",text:"This process of misrepresentation is not without historical parallel. For example, in countries which have considered government by one person (monarchy) necessary, the words "republic" or "democracy""},{photoname:"",text:"have been used precisely like "anarchy," to imply disorder and confusion. Those with a vested interest in preserving the status quo will obviously wish to imply that opposition to the current system cannot work in practice"},{photoname:"",text:", and that a new form of society will only lead to chaos. Or, as Errico Malatesta expresses it:"},{photoname:"",text:""since it was thought that government was necessary and that without government there could only be disorder and confusion, it was natural and logical that anarchy, which means absence of government, should sound like absence of order."[3]"},{photoname:"",text:"Anarchists want to change this "common-sense" idea of "anarchy," so people will see that government and other hierarchical social relationships are both harmful and unnecessary:"},{photoname:"",text:""Change opinion, convince the public that government is not only unnecessary, but extremely harmful, and then the word anarchy, just because it means absence of government, will come to mean for everybody: natural order,"},{photoname:"",text:"unity of human needs and the interests of all, complete freedom within complete solidarity."[4]"},{photoname:"",text:"This FAQ is part of the process of changing the commonly-held ideas regarding anarchism and the meaning of anarchy. But that is not all. As well as combating the distortions produced by the "common-sense" idea of "anarchy","},{photoname:"",text:"we also have to combat the distortions that anarchism and anarchists have been subjected to over the years by our political and social enemies. For, as Bartolomeo Vanzetti put it, anarchists are "the radical of the radicalâ€”"},{photoname:"",text:"the black cats, the terrors of many, of all the bigots, exploiters, charlatans, fakers and oppressors. Consequently we are also the more slandered, misrepresented, misunderstood and persecuted of all."[5]"},{photoname:"",text:"Vanzetti knew what he was talking about. He and his comrade Nicola Sacco were framed by the US state for a crime they did not commit and were, effectively, electrocuted for being foreign anarchists in 1927."},{photoname:"",text:"So this FAQ will have to spend some time correcting the slanders and distortions that anarchists have been subjected to by the capitalist media, politicians, ideologues and bosses"},{photoname:"",text:"(not to mention the distortions by our erstwhile fellow radicals like liberals and Marxists). Hopefully once we are finished you will understand why those in power have spent so much time attacking anarchismâ€”"},{photoname:"",text:"it is the one idea which can effectively ensure liberty for all and end all systems based on a few having power over the many."},{photoname:"",text:"The word "anarchy" is from the Greek, prefix an (or a), meaning "not," "the want of," "the absence of," or "the lack of", plus ####### meaning "a ruler," "director", "chief," "person in charge," or "authority.""},{photoname:"",text:"Or, as Peter Kropotkin put it, Anarchy comes from the Greek words meaning "contrary to authority."[6]"},{photoname:"",text:"While the Greek words ######## and anarchia are often taken to mean "having no government" or "being without a government," as can be seen, the strict, original meaning of anarchism was not simply"},{photoname:"",text:""no government." "An-archy" means "without a ruler," or more generally, "without authority," and it is in this sense that anarchists have continually used the word. For example, we find Kropotkin arguing that anarchism "},{photoname:"",text:""attacks not only capital, but also the main sources of the power of capitalism: law, authority, and the State."[7] For anarchists, anarchy means "not necessarily absence of order"},{photoname:"",text:", as is generally supposed, but an absence of rule."[8] Hence David Weick's excellent summary:"},{photoname:"",text:""Anarchism can be understood as the generic social and political idea that expresses negation of all power, sovereignty, domination, and hierarchical division, and a will to their dissolution... Anarchism is therefore more than anti-statism... "},{photoname:"",text:" [even if] government (the state)... is, appropriately, the central focus of anarchist critique."[9]"},{photoname:"",text:"For this reason, rather than being purely anti-government or anti-state, anarchism is primarily a movement against hierarchy. Why? Because hierarchy is the organisational structure that embodies authority.
